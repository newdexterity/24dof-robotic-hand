# Palm Structure for 24-DOF Robotic Hand

This directory contains the 3D model files for the palm structure of the 24-DOF anthropomorphic robotic hand.

## Anatomical Design

The palm design closely follows human anatomical structure with:
- Accurate metacarpal bone placement and orientation
- Simplified carpal bone structures
- Anthropomorphic joint positioning and alignment
- Biomimetic arches (transverse and longitudinal)

## Directory Structure

- **carpal_bones/** - Simplified carpal bone structures forming the base of the palm
- **metacarpals/** - Individual metacarpal designs for each finger

## Design Features

### Anatomical Accuracy
- The palm incorporates the natural arch of the human hand
- Metacarpal spacing matches human proportions
- Proper joint angles for naturalistic finger placement

### Tendon Routing
- Integrated channels for proper tendon path management
- Strategically placed guides to minimize friction
- Pulley systems for efficient force transmission

### Biomechanical Considerations
- Structural reinforcement at high-stress areas
- Optimized weight distribution
- Balance between strength and weight

### Integration Features
- Mounting points for wrist attachment
- Secure connection points for finger metacarpals
- Provisions for sensor integration

## Technical Specifications

- **Material Recommendations**: PETG or PLA+ with 40-50% infill
- **Print Orientation**: Split models should be printed flat side down
- **Support Requirements**: Minimal supports needed for overhangs
- **Assembly Hardware**: Uses M2 and M3 screws for component attachment

## Assembly Notes

1. Begin with assembling the carpal bone structure
2. Attach metacarpals in anatomically correct positions
3. Verify smooth articulation at CMC joints
4. Install internal tendon routing guides before completing assembly
5. Refer to the detailed assembly guide in the documentation directory
