# Carpal Bone Components for 24-DOF Robotic Hand

This directory contains the 3D models for the simplified carpal bone structures of the 24-DOF anthropomorphic robotic hand.

## Anatomical Design

The carpal bones form the base of the palm and connect to the wrist joint. This design uses simplified carpal structures that maintain the key functional aspects of human carpals while reducing complexity:

- Simplified from 8 human carpals to 3 functional groups
- Maintains proper articulation surfaces
- Preserves natural wrist movement

## Component Files

- **carpal_1.stl** - Main carpal block (scaphoid/lunate/triquetrum simplified)
- **carpal_2.stl** - Secondary carpals (trapezium/trapezoid)
- **carpal_3.stl** - Ulnar carpals (hamate/capitate)

## Design Features

### Wrist Interface

- Articulation surface for 2-DOF wrist movement
- Mounting points for secure wrist attachment
- Channels for tendon routing from forearm

### Metacarpal Connections

- Anatomically positioned mounting points for each metacarpal
- Specialized connection for thumb CMC joint
- Integrated support structure for palm arch

### Biomechanical Elements

- Maintains natural transverse arch of the palm
- Provides structural stability for grasping forces
- Simplified design while preserving functional biomechanics

## Technical Details

- **Internal Structure**: Hollowed design with reinforcement ribs
- **Tendon Channels**: Multiple routing paths for tendons from actuation unit
- **Connection Methods**: M3 screws and interlocking features

## Printing Recommendations

- **Layer Height**: 0.15-0.20mm
- **Orientation**: Print with the proximal (wrist) face down
- **Support**: Required for overhangs in joint surfaces
- **Infill**: 40-50% for structural integrity
- **Material**: PETG recommended for durability

## Assembly Notes

1. The carpal components connect with interlocking features
2. Use M3 screws to secure assemblies together
3. Verify proper alignment with wrist components before final assembly
4. Ensure smooth movement at the wrist articulation 
5. Test tendon routing paths before completing assembly
